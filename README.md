# stock-screen(er)

A pet project to learn how to make a decent looking/functional/maintainable front end tool ui, and maybe to teach me a thing or two about the stock market.  

JS build/insane boilerplate from mxstbr/react-boilerplate.

Libraries Used (excluding stuff included by the boilerplate generator, which are many):
  - React
  - GoldenLayout

Running the thing: 
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
